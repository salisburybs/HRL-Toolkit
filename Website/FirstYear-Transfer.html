<strong>Below are the steps to join our vibrant on-campus living and learning experience, followed by key dates and deadlines:</strong>
<h3>Step 1: Pay Deposits</h3>
Incoming first-year and transfer students&nbsp;must pay the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.uri.edu/enrollment/enrollment-deposit/">Enrollment Deposit with Housing</a>. &nbsp;Please allow&nbsp;<strong>three business days</strong>&nbsp;for these payments to be processed by URI. &nbsp;If you have any questions about the&nbsp;Enrollment Deposit please contact URI Admission at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:admission@uri.edu">admission@uri.edu</a>.
<h3>Step 2: Complete Housing Application in E-Campus</h3>
Once you have&nbsp;been accepted to URI, registered&nbsp;for e-Campus access, and paid the Enrollment Deposit with Housing, you&nbsp;may complete the application process by visiting <a href="https://web.uri.edu/ecampus/student-access/">Student e-Campus</a>.

Once logged into e-Campus:
<ol>
 	<li><a href="https://web.uri.edu/housing/apply/how-to-log-into-myhousing/">Log into&nbsp;MyHousing</a>;</li>
 	<li>Select the “Applications” tab;</li>
 	<li>Select and complete the “First-Year Student Application” or "Transfer Student Application";</li>
 	<li>Finally, follow the link provided to&nbsp;<a href="https://web.uri.edu/dining">Dining Services</a>&nbsp;and complete and submit a <a href="https://web.uri.edu/dining/compare-and-purchase-a-meal-plan/">Resident Student Meal Plan</a> application.</li>
</ol>
Students&nbsp;who miss the application deadline will not receive a guarantee of on-campus housing in one of the University’s residences.
<h3>Step 3: &nbsp;(optional) Request Roommates</h3>
Once you&nbsp;have completed the housing application, you can&nbsp;log back in to search for/request other first-year students&nbsp;as roommates, if they have completed their own housing application. &nbsp;Note: it may take up to 24 hours after a student completes their housing application for them to appear in the roommate selection tool. <a href="https://web.uri.edu/ecampus/">Log in to your MyHousing Account through e-Campus</a>.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://web.uri.edu/housing/apply/how-to-log-into-myhousing/">Log into&nbsp;MyHousing</a>;</li>
 	<li>Choose “Room Selection” tab;</li>
 	<li>Choose “Roommate Selection” from the menu;</li>
 	<li>In the search box, find&nbsp;an incoming first-year student to add as a roommate;</li>
 	<li>Choose&nbsp;the name of the student who you want as a roommate;</li>
 	<li>Press&nbsp;the “Continue” button.</li>
</ul>
First-year students may ADD, DELETE or CHANGE roommate requests until the first-year housing application deadline.&nbsp;Only students who have completed their own housing application will appear in the search results.

Roommate requests must be reciprocal. This means that the&nbsp;roommates you select must also select you&nbsp;<strong>and any&nbsp;other person in the room</strong> to create&nbsp;a “<em>fully matched group</em>”. To be certain that your roommate group is “fully matched” please check your MyHousing account.
